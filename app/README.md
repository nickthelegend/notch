# Loom — native app (Expo / React Native)

The native carrier of the loom daemon API: board, live thread, agent chips, the
**Tasks** view — the repo's open issues/PRs, where one tap hands an issue to an agent —
and the **Changes** view: per-prompt diffs (`turn_diff` events) and the live working
tree (`GET /api/projects/:id/tree`).

## Run it

```bash
cd app
npx expo install        # installs deps pinned for the Expo SDK
npx expo start          # scan the QR with Expo Go (Android/iOS)
```

## Build the APK (standalone, includes voice input)

```bash
cd app
npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
# → app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Testing over USB without Tailscale: `adb reverse tcp:7420 tcp:7420` makes the phone's
`127.0.0.1:7420` reach the daemon on your computer — pair with a
`http://127.0.0.1:7420/app#pair=…` link while plugged in. For wireless, use
`loom up --restart --tailnet && loom pair` as usual.

## Voice input

The composer has a mic button (APK / dev builds): tap → speak → live transcript lands
in the input (appended to anything already typed), tap again or hit send to stop.
On-device recognition via expo-speech-recognition; the button hides itself in
environments without the native module (e.g. plain Expo Go).

Your phone must reach the daemon — same tailnet, daemon bound to it:

```bash
loom up --restart --tailnet
loom pair               # gives you the URL + pairing token for the Pair screen
```

Paste the whole pair link (or the URL + token separately) into the Pair screen.
Credentials are stored in the device keychain (expo-secure-store).

## What's inside

- `App.tsx` — hand-rolled 3-screen router (Pair → Board → Project), no nav deps.
- `src/api.ts` — daemon client (REST + WS URL builder), typed to the loom API.
- `src/screens.tsx` — Board (needs-input dots, route badges, $), Project with
  **Thread** (live WS events, chips that shift the baton on send, route banner),
  **Tasks** (issues/PRs from `GET /api/projects/:id/tasks`, read through the daemon
  host's own `gh`), and **Changes** (working tree: branch, changed files, colored
  patch).
- `src/components.tsx` — event renderer (`turn_diff` events are expandable cards
  showing exactly what a prompt changed) and `TaskRow`.

**Tasks is the "check from my phone" story finished**: see an issue on the train, tap
it, confirm, and an agent is working before you look up. It confirms first because the
desktop shows you the brief in an editable field and a tap has no such beat — and this
one spends money and moves the baton. When the daemon host has no `gh`, is signed out,
or the project has no GitHub remote, the tab says which; it never shows an empty list to
mean "unavailable".

## Push notifications

Open the app once after pairing — it asks permission, fetches its Expo push token, and
registers it with the daemon (`POST /api/push/register`, attached to this device's
paired-client record). The daemon then pushes on `needs_input`, `route_completed`,
`route_failed`, and solo `run_complete` — route hops are suppressed on the server so
pipelines buzz once. Test from the computer: `loom clients --ping`.

## Notes

- If dependency versions drift from your Expo SDK: `npx expo install --fix`.
- Remote push in **Expo Go** works on SDK 52 (this app's pin); for store builds use a
  dev build / EAS as usual.
