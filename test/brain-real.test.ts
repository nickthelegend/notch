/**
 * The brain against a real model.
 *
 * Everything in brain-extract.test.ts stubs the LLM so the logic is
 * deterministic. This file does the opposite: it drives the FULL extractor
 * through the actual logged-in Claude CLI, so the prompt, the JSON contract,
 * and the evidence guard are all exercised end to end for real.
 *
 * Double-gated, because a real LLM costs tokens and ~15s a call: it runs only
 * when LOOM_TEST_REAL=1 is set AND Claude is reachable. A plain `npm test`
 * skips it; `LOOM_TEST_REAL=1 npm test` exercises it. When skipped it passes
 * quietly rather than failing — the same posture the runtime takes: a missing
 * extractor is a no-op, never an error.
 *
 * A real model is nondeterministic, so the assertions are about invariants that
 * must hold for ANY sensible extraction, not exact text:
 *   - it learns at least something from a fact-dense turn;
 *   - every memory it kept quotes a span that really appears in the turn (the
 *     anti-hallucination guard did its job);
 *   - a turn with nothing worth remembering yields nothing.
