/**
 * Driving a GUI agent's chat box over CDP — against a real Chromium.
 *
 * Antigravity and Kiro can't be tested here. Neither shows a composer until you
 * sign in (Antigravity) or open the chat panel (Kiro), and neither will do that
 * in CI. So this tests the part that IS testable and is where the bugs live:
 * the mechanism. A real browser, a real page with a real chat box, real CDP.
 *
 * It uses Electron's Chromium (already a devDependency of desktop/) rather than
 * asking for another browser download.
 *
 * The most important test in here is the one that refuses. Both target apps are
 * VS Code-family, and Monaco — the editor holding YOUR SOURCE FILE — is a
 * contenteditable. A driver that guesses will one day type a prompt into your
 * code and press Enter.

/**

 * Not a convenient page — the real one. The structure comes from
 * antigravity_phone_chat's selectors: a `#conversation` panel, a Lexical
 * composer inside it (`data-lexical-editor`), a submit button that is an
 * `svg.lucide-arrow-right` wrapped in a `<button>`, and a cancel button carrying
 * `data-tooltip-id="input-send-button-cancel-tooltip"` that appears while it's
 * generating. Plus the Monaco editor holding a source file, because that's the
 * thing the driver must never type into.
 *
 * The composer refuses assignment on purpose: `textContent = …` leaves it
 * "empty" as far as the submit button is concerned, exactly like Lexical. Only a
 * real `beforeinput` counts. A driver that cheats fails here — which is how the
 * execCommand path was caught: it fires `input` and not `beforeinput`, so it
 * filled the box and sent nothing.
