/**
 * Poll until a condition holds.
 *
 * The default was 8s, chosen for "wait for the DOM to settle". Most callers are
 * that. But app-dom.test.ts drives a real daemon inside jsdom while 56 other
 * files run in parallel, and its waits are on real work: an agent turn, a
 * `/api/setup` that spawns a CLI probe per agent (4.8-6.0s on an *idle*
 * machine), a `/api/doctor` that shells out. Against 8s that is barely more
 * than 1x of headroom, so the suite produced a rotating cast of one-test
 * failures — markdown rendering, then settings, then the command palette —
 * that all looked like separate bugs and were one budget.
 *
 * 20s, because a wait that is genuinely never going to succeed still fails; it
 * just takes longer to say so. Trading a slower red for a trustworthy green is
 * the right way round when the alternative is a suite people learn to re-run.
 * The one real bug this masked — a leaked in-flight turn — was found and fixed
 * on its own merits (see settleTurns in app-dom.test.ts), not by waiting longer.
