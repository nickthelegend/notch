/**
 * Forgetting a project.
 *
 * `unregisterProject` sat in core/registry.ts with no caller for the whole life
 * of the project: you could point Notch at a directory over the API and had no
 * supported way to un-point it, short of editing ~/.loom/registry.json by hand
 * and restarting the daemon. These tests exist so the route can't quietly lose
 * its wiring again.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the last one. "Forget" must not mean "delete":
 * the project's .loom/ holds its event log and its memory, and a tool that
 * throws those away because someone tidied a list is a tool you cannot trust
 * with the history it is selling you.
