/**
 * MCP servers — turning the project's configured list into something the agents
 * actually receive.
 *
 * Until this existed, `config.mcps` was a list you could edit and nothing else:
 * it was written by the composer, read back by GET /mcps, and never once handed
 * to an agent. A row said "connected" because it had a URL typed into it, which
 * is not the same claim at all. Both halves of that are fixed here.
 *
 *   1. `writeMcpSession` renders the enabled servers into the standard
 *      `{"mcpServers": {…}}` document, in a temp file the adapter passes to its
 *      CLI for one turn and which is deleted afterwards. Nothing is left behind
 *      in the project, and nothing survives a turn it wasn't meant for.
 *
 *   2. `probeMcpServer` asks the server whether it is there. A bounded HTTP
 *      round-trip is a weak signal — it proves an endpoint answered, not that it
 *      speaks MCP — but it is a *measurement*, and the alternative on offer was
 *      `!!url`. A server that refuses the connection is reported as unreachable,
 *      which is the honest reading.
 *
 * Two CLIs consume this, and they take it differently — see the adapters:
 * `claude --mcp-config <file>` reads the document, `codex -c mcp_servers.<key>=…`
 * takes TOML overrides (verified against claude 2.1.193 and codex-cli 0.144.6 by
 * running both, not by reading docs).
