 * a machine without claude or opencode got a project whose "agent" faked every

 * of where they sat in a list in this file. Nobody decided that. It read like a
 * recommendation Loom had earned, it was an accident of iteration order, and it
 * quietly shaped how people used their own agents.
 *
 * A role is a job you define. Loom doesn't know which of your agents should
 * plan, and pretending it does is worse than saying nothing — so the default
 * describes rather than assigns ("codex" is codex), and you rename it to the
 * job you actually have. The rail's agent picker does that; so does
