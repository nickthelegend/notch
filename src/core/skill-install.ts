/**
 * Installing a skill — copying somebody else's SKILL.md into this project.
 *
 * Discovery (core/skills.ts) answers "what do I already have". This answers the
 * other half: a skill you found in a gist, a repo, or a folder on disk becomes
 * `<projectDir>/skills/<id>/`, which is the first root the loader scans and the
 * only one Notch is allowed to write to.
 *
 * ## Why so much of this file is refusal
 *
 * Both entry points take a string from an HTTP body and turn it into filesystem
 * writes, so the interesting cases are all the ones that must not happen:
 *
 *   - **The id is a path.** `id` is joined onto `<projectDir>/skills/`, so an id
 *     of `../../.ssh` writes outside the project. It is validated against a
 *     character class rather than sanitised, because silently rewriting a
 *     malicious id into a benign one installs a skill under a name the caller
 *     didn't ask for, and then everything downstream is about the wrong skill.
 *
 *   - **The URL is a command.** `installSkillFromGit` runs git. Every argument
 *     goes through `execFile` with an array — never a shell string — so a URL
 *     containing `;` or `$(…)` is a URL git will fail to clone, not a command.
 *     The URL is also checked to be http(s) or ssh git first: git happily
 *     accepts `ext::sh -c …` and `--upload-pack=…` as "remotes", and those are
 *     code execution with extra steps.
 *
 *   - **An overwrite is silent.** Installing over an existing skill destroys
 *     whatever the user wrote there. It needs `force`, and the error says which
 *     id collided so the UI can offer the choice instead of guessing.
 *
 * A clone is bounded (90s) and runs with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`: a private repo
 * must fail as a private repo, not hang a request forever on a credential prompt
 * that nobody is at a terminal to answer.
