/**
 * Skills — SKILL.md context blocks injected into an agent's system prompt.
 *
 * A skill is a directory `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (name,
 * description) and a markdown body. Enabled skills (per project, in
 * .loom/config.json) get their bodies prepended to the briefing so every agent
 * follows the same conventions/procedures. Plus a keyword matcher that suggests
 * a relevant skill as the user types.
 *
 * ## Why the search widened
 *
 * This used to look in exactly two places: the project's own `skills/` and the
 * daemon's bundled one. Which meant that on a machine with dozens of skills
 * already installed — `~/.claude/skills`, plus everything a marketplace plugin
 * dropped into `~/.claude/plugins/cache/…` — Notch reported that you had one.
 * The skills were right there on disk and the picker said "agent-triage"
 * and nothing else. That is not a small omission: skills are the one place a
 * user writes down how their agents should behave, and Notch was ignoring all
 * of them because it only knew one directory layout.
 *
 * `discoverSkillRoots` knows the four layouts that actually exist. Each root
 * carries an `origin` so a manifest can say where it came from, because "you
 * have 60 skills" is much less useful than "3 of these are yours, 40 came from
 * a plugin, and this one is the project's". First root wins on a duplicate id,
 * so a project can shadow a user skill with its own version of the same name —
 * the same precedence Claude Code itself uses.
