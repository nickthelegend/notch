/**
 * The MCP catalog — where a server comes from before it is a row in config.
 *
 * core/mcp.ts is the back half of this story: it takes the servers a project has
 * configured and puts them in front of an agent. This is the front half, and it
 * is the half that didn't exist. Until now the only way to add a server was to
 * know its URL and type it into a prompt — so the composer shipped six hardcoded
 * rows with empty urls (GitHub, Slack, Supabase, …) which looked like
 * integrations and were placeholders. A logo is not an integration, and neither
 * is a name with nothing behind it.
 *
 * Two sources, and the difference between them is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. **The official registry** (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io). Thousands
 *      of servers, searchable, maintained by somebody else. Everything in here
 *      is normalised from what the registry actually returned — nothing is
 *      filled in, and an entry that is installable by neither a URL nor a
 *      package is dropped rather than shown as a row that can't be clicked.
 *
 *   2. **A curated shortlist** of well-known providers, for the empty state,
 *      because "search 4000 servers" is a bad first screen and the registry's
 *      ranking is not ours to reinterpret. Every URL and command in that list
 *      was verified against the vendor's own documentation and, where it is a
 *      remote, probed for a live response. An entry that could NOT be pinned
 *      to a single correct endpoint — because the hostname carries the
 *      account's region, or because it is only ever self-hosted — carries
 *      `needsUrl`, and the UI asks instead of guessing. A wrong URL is worse
 *      than an empty field: it fails at handshake with an auth error that
 *      looks like the user's fault.
 *
 * ## Why the cache exists
 *
 * The catalog modal searches as you type. Without a cache that is one HTTP
 * request per keystroke against somebody else's public service, which is rude
 * at best and rate-limited at worst. A short TTL is enough — the registry does
 * not change between two keystrokes, and 60 seconds of staleness in a browse
 * list costs nothing.
 *
 * ## Why a failed fetch is `degraded` and not an error
 *
 * A laptop on a plane still deserves the curated list. Returning an empty array
 * would read as "there are no MCP servers", which is false; throwing would take
 * the modal down over a network blip. `degraded: true` says exactly what
 * happened — the registry did not answer, this is what we know without it — and
 * the UI can say so out loud.
