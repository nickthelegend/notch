/**
 * Source control that does something.
 *
 * worktree.ts reads: what changed, what the patch is. This writes: stage,
 * unstage, discard, commit. The split is deliberate — reading is safe and runs
 * on a timer, writing touches your repository and only ever happens because you
 * clicked something.
 *
 * ## Why every path is checked instead of trusted
 *
 * These take file paths from an HTTP body, and `git checkout -- <path>` deletes
 * your work. A path that escapes the project ("../../etc/…") would let a paired
 * device discard files outside the repo entirely. Every path is resolved and
 * confirmed to sit inside the project before git sees it, and `--` separates
 * paths from flags so a file named `-f` can't become one.
 *
 * ## Why errors come back instead of being swallowed
 *
 * worktree.ts's git() resolves "" on failure, which is right for a read — a
 * missing branch name isn't worth an exception. It is wrong for a write: a
 * commit that silently does nothing is the worst outcome available. These throw
 * with git's own stderr, which is nearly always the actual answer ("nothing to
 * commit", "please tell me who you are").
