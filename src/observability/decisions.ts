/**
 * Decision capture — the KAIRO-style "what did each agent decide, and why".
 *
 * Every substantial agent turn contains deliberate choices (a tech pick, an
 * approach, a fix). This extracts them into structured AgentDecisions, through
 * whichever extractor this machine actually has, in descending order of how much
 * it can be trusted to judge its own certainty:
 *
 *   "llm"       the Anthropic API, when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set;
 *   "cli"       a signed-in local agent CLI driven headlessly — `agy --print`
 *               (Antigravity, cheap Gemini model) or `claude -p`. Same trick
 *               observability/triage.ts uses to get real prose with no API key;
 *   "heuristic" a regex over the prose, when there is no model at all.
 *
 * That order is also why `confidence` is OPTIONAL. A model reading the turn can
 * say how sure the agent sounded; a regex matching "I'll use X because Y"
 * cannot, and the constants it used to stamp (70/75/78/80) were rendered to
 * users as a measured percentage with a progress bar and averaged into a fleet
 * "Avg confidence" tile. A heuristic decision now carries no confidence at all,
 * and `source` says how it was extracted, so nothing downstream has to guess
 * whether a number was measured or invented.
 *
 * The result is persisted per project and surfaced in the Observatory Decision
 * Explorer, the Timeline, and the Time-Travel Replay.
