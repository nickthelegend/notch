/**
 * Reading Notch's own logs back out of SigNoz.
 *
 * Notch already *emits* structured logs over OTLP (see observability/logs.ts).
 * This is the other half: the query that lets the Observatory show an agent what
 * it actually said, correlated to the span it said it in.
 *
 * Two things make this different from the span read-back in insights.ts:
 *
 *  1. There is NO local fallback. Spans have one — `insightSpansFromLog` derives
 *     equivalent spans from the event log, because a span is a summary of an
 *     event Notch already has on disk. A log line is not: severity, body and the
 *     trace/span correlation only exist once the log record has been built and
 *     shipped. Reconstructing something log-shaped from the event log would be
 *     inventing data, so when ClickHouse is unreachable the caller reports
 *     `from: "unavailable"` and the UI says so plainly.
 *
 *  2. The identity filter is doubled up. `resources_string['service.name']`
 *     pins us to Notch (rather than any other service shipping to the same
 *     SigNoz), and `attributes_string['notch.project']` pins us to one project.
 *     Confirmed against the live table: Notch sets notch.project as a *record*
 *     attribute, not a resource attribute, so it lands in attributes_string —
 *     one daemon's logs would otherwise leak into another project's view.
