/**
 * Kinds Loom will still *build* but no longer *offers*.
 *
 * The Antigravity CDP bridge drove the IDE's chat panel over DevTools and could
 * only watch; `antigravity-cli` replaced it with a real adapter that holds the
 * baton, so the bridge came out of ADES. Coming out of ADES took it off every
 * surface that advertises an agent — except one: `addAgent` validated against
 * this registry, so POST /api/projects/:id/agents accepted `kind:"antigravity"`
 * from anyone who guessed the name and put a withdrawn thing in your roster
 * that no view would offer you.
 *
 * The registration stays because deleting it would break the projects that
 * already name it: `createAgent` throws on an unknown kind, and every agent in
 * .loom/config.json is constructed when the project opens, so a withdrawn
 * registration is a project that won't open rather than an agent that quietly
 * stops. Same standing `echo` has — buildable if you ask for it by name, never
 * handed to anyone who didn't. What changed is that asking is now something you
 * do by editing your own config, not something the HTTP API will do for you.
