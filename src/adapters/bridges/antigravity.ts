/**
 * Antigravity bridge — presence, and now a way in.
 *
 * Antigravity is an Electron app with no API, no headless mode and no way to
 * talk to it but the DevTools port it opens when you ask for one. Launched with
 * --remote-debugging-port it speaks CDP, and CDP is enough to see it, type into
 * its chat and read what comes back. The approach is the one
 * krishnakanthb13/antigravity_phone_chat takes to put Antigravity on a phone:
 * don't touch the provider APIs, don't lift the tokens — drive the app that's
 * already signed in, exactly as a person would.
 *
 * It stays a BRIDGE rather than becoming an adapter, and that isn't timidity:
 *
 *   - Antigravity edits the tree on its own schedule and knows nothing about
 *     Loom's baton. Handing it the baton would be a promise Loom can't keep,
 *     because nothing stops Antigravity from writing while another agent holds
 *     it. A bridge never holds the baton, so the lock keeps meaning something.
 *   - What comes back is the chat panel's text, not the model's response. Good
 *     enough to read; not something to hand to a router as a result.
 *
 * So: send with your own hands, read with your own eyes, from anywhere. What
 * Loom adds is that the thread and the memory projection stay in one place.
